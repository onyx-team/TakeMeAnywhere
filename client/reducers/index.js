  rootReducer combines all reducers from the app and combines it all into a single state object a.k.a the store;

  The results of this modularization of reducers allows us to access them via props in the containers as such:
    a) this.props.moods => output of MoodReducer
    b) this.props.contstraints => output of ConstraintReducer
    c) etc...
